This is a simple example to demonstrate how to use [@graphcms/uix-sdk](https://github.com/GraphCMS/uix-sdk/) with vanilla JS.

## How to Use

Deploy the code to Vercel, or run locally, and install on GraphCMS as a UI extension using the URL to your index page as the URL for your extension, and run the compatibility test.

Follow the guide on [working with GraphCMS UI extensions](https://graphcms.com/guides/working-with-ui-extensions).
