## Component Date Field Manipulation App

In this example, we are using the App SDK Form API to change another field's value based on the date selected in a field in the component level.

Keep in mind this is a **workaround** that introduces redundancy in your model, meaning that if you need to update these fields via the API, you would need to keep them in sync.
