# UI Extensions ⨯ Focal Point

[Join our Slack](https://slack.graphcms.com)

This is a simple example to demonstrate how to use [@graphcms/uix-sdk](https://github.com/GraphCMS/uix-sdk/) with vanilla JS.

## How to Use

Deploy the code to Vercel, or run locally, and install on GraphCMS as a UI extension using the URL to your index page as the URL for your extension, and run the compatibility test.

You can get started with our hosted example, but you should deploy and maintain this on your own host: `https://graphcms-uix-focal-point.vercel.app/`

Follow the guide on [working with GraphCMS UI extensions](https://graphcms.com/guides/working-with-ui-extensions).
