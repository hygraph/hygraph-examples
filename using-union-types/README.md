# Working with union types in GraphCMS

[Join our Slack](https://slack.graphcms.com)

GraphCMS supports [polymorphic relations](https://graphcms.com/docs/guides/concepts/relations/#union-types-polymorphism), also known as [GraphQL union types](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#union-types). This example demonstrates how you can build a product marketing page using a schema consisting of polymorphic relations.

This example is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), [`graphql-request`](https://github.com/prisma-labs/graphql-request) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com).
